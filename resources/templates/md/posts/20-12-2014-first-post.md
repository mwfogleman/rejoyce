This is my first post in my new technical blog, "rejoyce." I'm a real
coder now that I have one of these things!

In case it's not obvious, I'm using the swanky new static blog
generator, [Cryogen](https://lacarmen.github.io/cryogen/index.html). I
haven't (yet) figured out much about how to theme these darn
"web-page" things you new-fangled kids have dreamed up. But having
nothing fancy to wear is no excuse to skip a party, so here I am.

Be sure to check out the "About" page for some clues as to what I'll
be posting about (hint: this hint has parentheses in it).
